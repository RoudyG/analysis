💡#MARKETING ANALYSIS

📊finding out if users tend to spend more time on your website on certain weekdays and weekends how that behavior differs .										
The analysis shows that the referral  is the most effective  in terms of event value, count of users, and time duration engaged.										
The organic  comes second after the referral , but referral  is still better when comparing										
total events and purchases through A/B testing with 99% confidence interval.										
										
📊The analysis also shows that campaigns related to special occasions are more effective in engaging existing users for longer durations,										
while campaigns related to organic and referral sources are better in acquiring new users and engaging them on the website.

💡#PRODUCT ANALYSIS 

  based around tiny angle, trying to find the backdraws and what further analysis could we do more ,
  You have a follow up task from your product manager to identify how much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on your website.
  MY PM would like to see the users' duration from first arriving on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day. Your final result should show the duration dynamic daily.
  Created a presentation centered around the dynamic daily duration.

💡#CLV (customer life value) CALCULATION,
   * customers who purchased something, while marketing is counting all user registrations that they manage to bring to  ecommerce site. 
   * Thus, I adjust calculations to include all users who have been on  website, not only the one who purchased something.
   * Next I produced the same chart, but the revenue / registrations for a particular week cohort will be expressed as a cumulative sum.
   * last, I focused on the future and try to predict the missing data.
