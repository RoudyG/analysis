HI THERE😊 MY PROJECTS ANALYSIS' LINKS📊:

💡#PRODUCT ANALYSIS 

  based around tiny angle, trying to find the backdraws and what further analysis could we do more ,
  You have a follow up task from your product manager to identify how much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on your website.
  MY PM would like to see the users' duration from first arriving on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day. Your final result should show the duration dynamic daily.
  Created a presentation centered around the dynamic daily duration.

💡#CLV (customer life value) CALCULATION,
   * customers who purchased something, while marketing is counting all user registrations that they manage to bring to  ecommerce site. 
   * Thus, I adjust calculations to include all users who have been on  website, not        only the one who purchased something.
   * Next I produced the same chart, but the revenue / registrations for a particular week cohort will be expressed as a cumulative sum.
   * last, I focused on the future and try to predict the missing data. In this case missing data is the revenue we should expect from later acquired user cohorts.
